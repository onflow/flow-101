## Prerequisites 
Let's make sure we have our rulers and calculator ready for class! You'll need these two items on your computer before we dive in: 

#### 1. Git
You can follow the [GitHub guide]() on how to install Git. 

#### 2. Flow CLI
Visit the [Flow CLI Installation](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/install) documentation & follow the instructions. You just need to run a single command in your terminal! If you already have it installed, make sure it‚Äôs the latest version.

## Step 0 - Clone the Repo
Clone this repo and you'll be all set for sending your first transaction to sign the yearbook!

```
git clone https://github.com/onflow/yearbook-workshop
```

## Step 1 - Start the Flow CLI
First things first, you will need to start the Flow CLI in order to use commands.
```javascript
flow init
```
You should see something like this: 
```Configuration initialized
Service account: 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7

Start emulator by running: 'flow emulator' 
Reset configuration using: 'flow init --reset'
```

## Step 2 - Create your Testnet Account
Before we can sign the yearbook, we'll need our own account! Luckily for us, we just need to run a simple command with the Flow CLI.

#### 1. Create a Testnet Account
```javascript
flow accounts create
```

#### 2. Name your Account
Name your new account `hero` and follow the rest of the instructions on screen.

```
Enter an account name: hero
```
> üí°You can pick any name, we are trying to keep the instructions in line with your experience. If you would decide to name your account differently, please use that name everywhere we refer to `hero` account and address.
> 

#### 3. Set your network to Flow Testnet
```
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê 
? Choose a network: 
    Local Emulator
  ‚ñ∏ Flow Testnet
    Flow Mainnet
```

#### 4. Save Account Info

```
‚úî Flow Testnet

‚ùó This command will perform the following:
 - Generate a new ECDSA P-256 public and private key pair.
 - Save the private key to hero.private.json and add it to .gitignore.
 - Create a new account on Flow Testnet paired with the public key.
 - Save the newly-created account to flow.json.

## Step 3 - Class is in Session!

The official Flow Yearbook contract is deployed to Testnet. 
- Contract Address: [0x5593df7d286bcdb8](https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/account/0x5593df7d286bcdb8) 

This repository contains all the Cadence scripts and transactions, which we will learn how to execute in this section. Exciting!

#### 1. Init Account

Run the following command

```bash
flow transactions send ./cadence/transactions/init-account.cdc --signer=hero --network=testnet
```

This step initiates your account so that you can call on the function that will send your message to the yearbook.


#### 2. Sign the Yearbook

Our Testnet account at `0x5593df7d286bcdb8` is initialized with Yearbook resource as well, so you can leave us a message ;)

Possible message keys are:

- hello, flow is cool
- i'm the greatest flow dev of all
- look ma, I signed a yearbook!
- 2kool4skool
- idk what i'm doing

Run the following command and pass arguments:

```bash
flow transactions send ./cadence/transactions/sign-yearbook.cdc 0x5593df7d286bcdb8 bff --signer=hero --network=testnet
```

#### 3. Read Messages from Yearbook

Checkout all the cool messages in the Flow Yearbook!

You can do so by running this script

```bash
flow scripts execute ./cadence/scripts/get-messages.cdc 0x5593df7d286bcdb8 --network=testnet
```
